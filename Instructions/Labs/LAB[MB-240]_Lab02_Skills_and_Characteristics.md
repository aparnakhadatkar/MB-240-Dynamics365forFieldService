# Practice Lab 2 - Skills and Characteristics

## Estimated timing: 20 minutes

## Exercise 1 - Configure Dynamics 365 for Field Service Skills and Characteristics

Each technician that goes out to service customers may have a number of different skills and roles assigned to them. There are three primary roles that a technician may have:

- Installation Specialist
- Site Inspector
- Security Analyst

Additionally, each technician may have specific skills or Certifications that relate to a specific product or service. The most common certifications might be any of the following:

- **CISM:** Certified Information Security Manager
- **CISSP:** Certified Information Systems Security Professional
- **G SEC:** GIAC Security Essentials

Since some of your customers are government agencies, technicians may need to have specific security clearance levels. These can range from Level One to Level Five.

### Task 1 – Proficiency Models

In this task, you will create a proficiency model that contains the five different security clearance levels and a proficiency model for skill level.

1. In the **Dynamics 365 Field Service app**, click the **Service (1)** area in the bottom-left of the sitemap, and select **Resources (2)** from the list.
