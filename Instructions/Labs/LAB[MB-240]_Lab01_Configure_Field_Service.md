# Practice Lab 1 - Configure Dynamics 365 Field Service

## Scenario

Worldwide Industries (WWI) provides IT and networking services to their customers. Their services range from phone system and network installations to telephoning systems and security system installations. They are going to be leveraging Dynamics 365 for Field Service for installation and servicing of these systems for their customers. You are the system implementor that has been tasked with configuring the application to support the rollout of the application. You will be adding and configuring some products that can be installed and setting up skills and characteristics that will be used as part of the implementation.

## Estimated timing: 10 minutes

## Exercise 1 – Map Configuration

### Task 1 - Enable Bing Maps to use with Resource Scheduling

To ensure that you can take full advantage of the full scheduling and mapping capabilities available with Field Service, you need to ensure that it is configured to use a mapping provider. Bing Maps is the default map provider, but additional providers could be enabled.  We will be using Bing Maps.

1. In the **Dynamics 365 Field Service app**, click the **Service (1)** area in the bottom-left of the sitemap, and select **Resources (2)** from the list.
